    <h1>Privacy Policy for Elemental</h1>
    <p>Last Updated: [Date]</p>

    <h2>Data Collection</h2>
    <p>At <strong>Elemental</strong>

We are committed to protecting your privacy. This privacy policy explains what data is collected when you use our app, how it is handled, and how you can manage your preferences.

Data Collection

We want to clarify that Elemental does not collect any personal or usage data from you directly. The only data collected comes from Google services, specifically Google Analytics and Google AdMob, which gather data related to app performance, usage patterns, and ads displayed within the app.

1. Google Analytics

We use Google Analytics to gather anonymous data on app usage, which helps us improve the performance and user experience of the app. Google Analytics may collect:

	•	Anonymous device and app usage information
	•	General location data (non-precise)
	•	Interaction data (e.g., screens viewed, session duration)

No personally identifiable information (PII) is collected by Elemental through Google Analytics. The data collected by Google is used for app performance analysis and is anonymized.

2. Google AdMob

Google AdMob is used to serve ads in the app. Google AdMob may collect:

	•	Device information (e.g., device type, operating system, Advertising ID)
	•	General, non-precise location data
	•	Interaction data related to ads (e.g., ad views, ad clicks)

This data is collected by Google for the purposes of serving personalized or non-personalized ads, depending on your settings and region. By default, ads may be non-personalized in regions that require user consent, such as the European Union.

How Data Is Used

The data collected by Google Analytics and Google AdMob is used to:

	•	Improve the app’s performance and usability
	•	Display ads within the app, either personalized or non-personalized, depending on your preferences

All data collection and processing are performed by Google, and Elemental does not have access to any personal information or directly identifiable data.

Managing Your Data Preferences

You can manage your data preferences for Google services by:

	•	Opting out of personalized ads: Adjust your device’s advertising settings to opt out of personalized ads (on iOS: Reset Advertising Identifier; on Android: Opt out of Ads Personalization) or visit Google’s Ad Settings.
	•	Opting out of Google Analytics: You can opt out of Google Analytics data collection by using Google’s opt-out tools or adjusting your device settings.

Children’s Privacy

The app is intended for users of all ages, but Elemental does not knowingly collect any personal information from children under 13. All data is collected and processed by Google. If you believe we have inadvertently collected personal information from a child, please contact us so we can address the issue.

Security

While we do not collect any personal data, we rely on Google to secure the data gathered by their services. Google has implemented security measures to protect data collected via Google Analytics and Google AdMob.

Changes to This Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time to reflect any changes in our app or services. When we make changes, we will update the “Last Updated” date at the top of this page. Continued use of the app after changes are made signifies acceptance of the updated policy.

This policy clearly states that Elemental does not collect any user data directly and only relies on Google services to gather usage and advertising data. It also includes information about how users can manage their data preferences related to Google Analytics and AdMob.
